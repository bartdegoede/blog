/**
 * Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

 * Fuse.js returns a fuzzy-match *distance* (lower is better, roughly
 * bounded 0-1 but shaped by its own internal scoring); the vector index
 * returns a *cosine similarity* (higher is better, bounded -1..1). These
 * two numbers live on incomparable scales - they are not the same unit,
 * not the same direction, and not the same distribution. Min-max
 * normalizing them into a common [0,1] range doesn't fix this: a
 * document's normalized score would then depend on the min/max of whatever
 * *other* documents happened to match that particular query, so the same
 * document could rank differently across two queries for reasons that have
 * nothing to do with the document itself. RRF sidesteps all of it by
 * discarding the scores entirely and keeping only each engine's ordinal
 * rank - ranks are always comparable, regardless of the scale or
 * distribution the underlying score came from.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<any>>} rankedLists - each a list of doc ids, best
 *   first (rank 1). A doc absent from a list is simply not scored by it -
 *   not penalized.
 * @param {number} [k=RRF_K]
 * @returns {Array<[doc: any, score: number]>} sorted descending by fused
 *   score, ties broken lexicographically by doc id
